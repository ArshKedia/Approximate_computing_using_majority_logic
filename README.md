## Design and Analysis of Majority Logic based Approximate Adders and Multipliers

# Aim
1. A new 2-bit MLAFA (Majority Logic Approximate Full Adder) is proposed based on truth table reduction; it can be used for multi-bit approximate adder design;<br/>

2. A 2 x 2 MLAM (Majority Logic Approximate Multiplier) is proposed and complement bits are introduced;<br/>

3. A novel analysis for selecting complement bits is presented;<br/>

4. MLACs (Majority Logic Approximate Compressors) based on K-Map simplification and 1-bit MLAFAs are proposed;<br/>

5. Exact as well as approximate pipelined reduction circuits for 4 x 4 and 8 x 8 MLAMs are proposed.<br/>
